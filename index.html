			<h1>Hi there, I'm Sankalp Sharma!</h1>
			<p>I am from Jaipur. I pursued Applied Mathematics at IIT Roorkee and graduated with a strong foundation in analytical thinking and problem-solving. I am currently working as a software developer, utilizing my skills to build innovative solutions.
Beyond my professional life, I have a diverse range of interests. Music holds a special place in my heart, and I enjoy listening to various genres. It helps me relax and find inspiration in my work. Additionally, I have a passion for sports, and I find joy in both watching and playing them. Whether it's football, cricket, badminton, or any other sport, I am always up for the excitement and thrill they offer.
Apart from these interests, I am also an avid trekker. Exploring nature and embarking on adventurous treks allows me to connect with the outdoors and rejuvenate my mind and body.
As a software developer with a love for music, sports, and trekking, I strive to bring creativity, problem-solving, and enthusiasm into everything I do. I am constantly seeking new challenges and opportunities to grow both personally and professionally.
